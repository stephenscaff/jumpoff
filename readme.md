# JumpOff

## Just a little Gulp starter to set it off.

Contains a bit of useful css, senseable scss/js structuring, a js includes system (see src/assets/js/app.js), Handlebars-enabled partials, and error notices. 

Also inlcudes a simple, lightweight server via `gulp-live-server`.

### Run

Just run `gulp` from the project. Everything builds out to a `dist` folder.
